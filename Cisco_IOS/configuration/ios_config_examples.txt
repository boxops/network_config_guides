# Set Up an IOS Router or Switch as SSH Client

# There are four steps required to enable SSH support on a Cisco IOS:

# 1. Configure the hostname command.
# 2. Configure the DNS domain.
# 3. Generate the SSH key to be used.
# 4. Enable SSH transport support for the virtual type terminal (vtys).

# OSPF

OSPF Neighbour Requirements

1. Area must match
2. Area must be in the same subnet
3. OSPF process must not be sutdown
4. OSPF Router IDs must be unique
5. Hello and Dead timers must match
6. Autohentication settings must match
7. IP MTU settings must match
8. OSPF Network Type must match


OSPF Types of LSA

Type 1 (Router LSA)
- Every OSPF rotuer generates this type of LSA.
- It identifies the router using its router ID.
- It also lists networks attached to the rotuer's OSPF-activated interfaces.

Type 2 (Network LSA)
- Generated by the DR of each 'multi-access' network (ie. the broadcast network type).
- Lists the routers which are attached to the multi-access network.

Type 5 (AS External LSA)
- Generated by ASBRs to describe routes to destinations outside of the AS (OSPF domain).
