### Configure Hostname

configure terminal
hostname R1
do sh run | inc hostname


### Configure an IP address on an Interface

interface FastEthernet0/0
ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown


### Configure a Management IP on a Layer 2 Switch

# 1. Enter the VLAN 1 configuration mode with the interface vlan 1 global configuration command and assign an IP address with the ip address IP_ADDRESS SUBNET_MASK interface subcommand, then enable the VLAN 1 interface with the no shutdown interface subcommand.
conf t
int vlan 1
ip add 192.168.111.100 255.255.255.0
no sh
exit
# 2. Use the ip default-gateway IP_ADDRESS global configuration command to configure the default gateway.
ip default-gateway 192.168.111.1
# 3. Add the ip name-server IP_ADDRESS global configuration command to configure the DNS server.
ip name-server 192.168.111.1


### Configure SSH on IOS Router or Switch

# There are four steps required to enable SSH support on a Cisco IOS:
# 1. Configure the hostname.
configure terminal
hostname R1
# 2. Configure the DNS domain.
ip domain name cisco.com
# 3. Generate the SSH key to be used.
crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024
# 4. Enable SSH transport support for the virtual type terminal (vtys).
line vty 0 15
transport input ssh
login local
exit
# 5. Enable SSH version 2.
ip ssh version 2
# 6. Create a user and password for SSH access.
username admin privilege 15 password Cisco123
end

## (Optional SSH Security): Add an ACL to allow incoming SSH connections.
# Apply a Standard ALC:
conf t
access-list 1 permit host 192.168.111.1
access-list 1 permit host 192.168.111.2
line vty 0 15
access-class 1 in
end
# OR Apply an Extended Named ACL:
ip access-list extended SSH_ACCESS_CONTROL
permit udp 192.168.111.1 0.0.0.255 any eq 22
permit tcp 192.168.111.1 0.0.0.255 any eq 22
deny udp any any eq 22
deny tcp any any eq 22
permit ip any any
line vty 0 15
access-class SSH_ACCESS_CONTROL in
end

## Note: Older IOS supports the kind of RSA with SHA-1, and SHA-1 is considered very weak. This essentially means that there are no secure ways to connect to it over SSH.
# Workaround on client (However, be aware that this is a workaround and it's known to be insecure.):
sudo tee -a ~/.ssh/config > /dev/null <<EOT
Host 192.168.111.1
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
    PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
    HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
EOT


### SSH Public Key Authentication
# Reference: https://networklessons.com/uncategorized/ssh-public-key-authentication-cisco-ios
# 1.1 Windows Configuration
# Create a .ssh directory in your home directory if it does not already exist:
mkdir /Users/username/.ssh
# Go to the .ssh folder:
cd /Users/username/.ssh
# Run ssh-keygen to generate an SSH key-pair:
ssh-keygen -t rsa
# 1.2 Linux Configuration
# Generate an RSA keypair:
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa
# 2. Enable SSH on Cisco IOS (refer to configuration above).
# Optionally, you can configure the router to disable SSH password authentication:
no ip ssh server authenticate user password
no ip ssh server authenticate user keyboard
# 3.1 Windows Public Key
# You can open the public key file (windows_user.pub) in your favorite text editor.
# Remove the “begin”, “end” and “comment” so that we only have the public key left.
# On the Cisco device, add the public key for a username we choose. we will call this user “WINDOWS_USER”. Once you enter the key-string command, you can keep adding lines until you type exit:
R1(config)#ip ssh pubkey-chain 
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey)#username WINDOWS_USER
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)#key-string
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAijoMF9oBwyQxwYbVlFprz+fG8oe5uAcCxwMw

R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#exit
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)#exit
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey)#exit
# The router now knows the public key of our windows users.
# 3.2 Linux Public Key
# Take a look at the public key:
cat /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# The key is printed on a single line, that’s fine but Cisco IOS only supports a maximum of 254 characters on a single line so you won’t be able to paste this in one go. 
# There is a useful Linux command you can use to break the public key in multiple parts:
fold -b -w 72 /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Remove the “ssh-rsa” part at the beginning and the comment at the end.
# Add the key to the router, we will use the username “LINUX_USER”:
R1(config)#ip ssh pubkey-chain 
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey)#username LINUX_USER
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)#key-string
R1(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC80DsOF4nkk15V0V2U7r4Q2MyAwIbgQX/7

# 4. Verification
# Once you added the public key to the router, Cisco IOS will calculate a key hash:
show running-config | begin pubkey
# SSH to the Cisco device from both Windows and Linux:
ssh -l admin 192.168.111.1

# Note: Lower device ID will decide which interfaces are active for EtherChannel regardless of the port priority configurations on the device with a higher device ID.
# LACP allows only one switch to make decisions about which interfaces are actively participating in the EtherChannel.
# The LACP system priority and the device ID (switch MAC address) are used to determine which switch is the decision maker.
# Change the LACP system priority value to make it the decision maker about active ports in the EtherChannel
lacp system-priority 100

## EtherChannel 'mode on' will bundle interfaces irrespective of the configuration of the interfaces on the opposite side of the link.
# Once interfaces are up and bundled, the port-channel interface will change to an up state and will be added to the spanning tree as a single logical link, replacing bundled member interfaces.
# You shoud shut down the interfaces before configuring EtherChannel on mode to prevent a spanning tree loop, then re-enable the interfaces.

### OSPF

# Before implementing OSPF on a network, you should always determine the desired precedence for DR and BDR election.
# Factors such as device speed, age of hardware, and the location of the device in relation to the rest of the devices in the broadcast network should be considered because they could affect network performance.
# Once the OSPF process is started on a router, it does not elect a new DR unless the DR and BDR fail or the OSPF process is restarted on all participating devices.
# If only the DR fails, the BDR will become the DR and a BDR will be elected from the remaining devices in the subnet.

# Enter router configuration mode for an OSPF process
router ospf [process-id]
# Sets the router priority, whic helps determine the designated router (DR) for the network
ip ospf priority [number-value]
# Activates OSPF on the specified network and places the matching interface in the specified area
network [network-address] [wildcard-mask] area [area-id]
# Display the OSPF link state database
show ip ospf [process-id [area-id]] database [router]
# Display OSPF interface information
show ip ospf interface [type number] [brief]
# Display OSPF neighbor information
show ip ospf [process-id [area-id]] neighbor
# Display the routing table
show ip route
# Display information on OSPF-related events, such as adjacencies, flooding information, DR selection, and shortest path first (SFP) calculation

# Display information about active routing protocols
show ip protocols
# Turn of all debugging
undebug all
# Restart the OSPF process
clear ip ospf process

## Force a router to become the DR for each of their respective broadcast networks:
# - Configure each router with a higher loopback IP interface address
# - Configure a higher router ID than the neighbor router
# - Configure higher OSPF priorities (takes precedence over the router ID) on the router you want to become the DR for the broadcast network.

# Configure a router with an OSPF priority of 0 to prevent it from being elected as a DR or BDR.
int g0/0
ip ospf priority 0


### NAT

# Create an address pool
ip nat pool [pool-name] [start-address] [end-address] netmask [subnet-mask]
# Define the inside interface for NAT
int g0/0
ip nat inside
# Define the outside interface for NAT
int g0/1
ip nat outside
# Create an ACL that denies or permits IP traffic from the specified address or address range
access-list [access-list-number] {deny | permit} [source-address] [source-wildcard]
# Translates anything that matches the ACL to an address from the pool (from global config mode, starts the NAT process)
ip nat inside source list [access-list-number] pool [pool-name]
# Translates anything matching the access list to the IP address of the interface specified
# - overload indicates that PAT will be used
ip nat inside source list [access-list-number] interface [type-number] overload
# Enable NAT translation of the inside source address
ip nat inside source static [inside-local-address] [inside-global-address]
# Enable NAT translation of the outside source address
ip nat outside source static [inside-local-address] [inside-global-address]

## NAT Configuration Example
# R1 (Internet facing router)
conf t
int g0/1
ip nat inside
int g0/0
ip nat outside
exit
# Create a pool of public IP addresses for NAT translation
ip nat pool NAT_POOL 200.152.100.65 200.152.100.70 netmask 255.255.255.248
# Create an ACL to cover the allowed host range for NAT translation (192.168.100.[129-130])
access-list 1 permit 192.168.100.128 0.0.0.3
# Begin the address translation process
ip nat inside source list 1 pool NAT_POOL
# Test ping connectivity from hosts then display the NAT translations table
show ip nat translations
# Display NAT information
