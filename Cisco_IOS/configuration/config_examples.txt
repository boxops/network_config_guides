do sh run | inc host


### Configure Interface with IP address

interface FastEthernet0/0
ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown


### Set Up an IOS Router or Switch as SSH Client

# There are four steps required to enable SSH support on a Cisco IOS:

# 1. Configure the hostname command.
# 2. Configure the DNS domain.
# 3. Generate the SSH key to be used.
# 4. Enable SSH transport support for the virtual type terminal (vtys).

### Standard ACL

# access-list number { deny | permit } ip wildcard-mask
access-list 1 deny 1.1.1.1 0.0.0.0
access-list 1 deny 1.1.1.1
access-list 1 deny host 1.1.1.1

### Better ACL Config

# Standard ACL
# Numbered ACL Ranges: 100-199, 2000-2699

ip access-list standard 1
# or
ip access-list standard BLOCK_PC1
deny 192.168.1.1
permit any
do show access list
# delete an entry
no 30

# insert a new entry by specifying the sequence number
30 deny 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255

# resequence ACLs
# ip access-list resequence [acl-id] [starting-seq-num] [increment]
# [starting-seq-num] = change the sequence number of the first entry to 10
# [increment] = add 10 for every entry after that
ip access-list resequence 1 10 10

# NOTE - When configuring or editing numbered ACLs from global config mode,
# you cannot delete individual entries, you can only delete the entire ACL!


### Extended ACLs

# Extendend Numbered ACL
# access-list [number] (permit | deny) [protocol] [src-ip] [dest-ip]

# Extended Named ACL
# ip access-list extended (name | number)
# [seq-num] (permit | deny) [protocol] [src-ip] [dest-ip]
ip acccess-list extended DENY_VLAN10
deny tcp any 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255

# examples
# allow all traffic
permit ip any any
# prevent 10.0.0.0/16 from sending UDP traffic to 192.168.1.1/32
deny udp 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 host 192.168.1.1
# prevent 172.16.1.1/32 from pinging hosts in 192.168.0.0/24
deny icmp host 172.16.1.1 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255
# When matching TCP or UDP, you can optionally specify the source and/or destination port numbers to match
deny tcp [src-ip] eq [src-port-num] [dest-ip]
deny tcp 10.1.1.1 eq 80 10.2.2.2
# eq 80 = equal to port 80
# gt 80 = greater than 80 (<81)
# lt 80 = less than 80 (>79)
# neq 80 = NOT 80
# range 80 100 = port from 80 to port 100

# After the destination IP address and/or port numbers, there are more options you can use to match
# ack = match TCP ACK flag
# fin = match TCP FIN flag
# syn = match TCP SYN flag
# ttl = match packets with a specific TTL value
# dscp = match packets with a specific DSCP value

# examples
# allow traffic from 10.0.0.0/16 to access the server at 2.2.2.2/32 using HTTPS
permit tcp 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 2.2.2.2 0.0.0.0 eq 443
# prevent all hosts using source UDP port numbers from 20000 to 30000 from accessing the server at 3.3.3.3/32
deny udp any range 20000 30000 host 3.3.3.3
# allow hosts in 172.16.1.0/24 using a TCP source port greater than 9999 to access all TCP ports on server 4.4.4.4/32 except port 23
permit tcp 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255 gt 9999 host 4.4.4.4 neq 23

# Applying Extended ACLs to interfaces
# Note - Extended ACLs should be applied as close to the soruce as possible to limit how far the packets travel in the network before being denied. Standard ACLs are less specific, so if they are applied close to the source there is a risk of blocking more than intended.

### Static Routing

# ip route [ remote network ] [ remote network subnet ] [ neighbour interface ]
ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.2.1

### OSPF Dynamic Routing

OSPF Neighbour Requirements

1. Area must match
2. Area must be in the same subnet
3. OSPF process must not be sutdown
4. OSPF Router IDs must be unique
5. Hello and Dead timers must match
6. Autohentication settings must match
7. IP MTU settings must match
8. OSPF Network Type must match


OSPF Types of LSA

Type 1 (Router LSA)
- Every OSPF rotuer generates this type of LSA.
- It identifies the router using its router ID.
- It also lists networks attached to the rotuer's OSPF-activated interfaces.

Type 2 (Network LSA)
- Generated by the DR of each 'multi-access' network (ie. the broadcast network type).
- Lists the routers which are attached to the multi-access network.

Type 5 (AS External LSA)
- Generated by ASBRs to describe routes to destinations outside of the AS (OSPF domain).

### SNMP

http://oid-info.com/

# SNMP Agent port = UDP 161
# SNMP Manager port = UDP 162

## SNMP Read Messages
# Messages sent by the NMS to read information from the managed devices.

# Get - A request sent from the manager to the agent to retrieve the value of a variable (OID), or multiple variables.
# The agent will send a Response message with the current value of each variable.

# GetNext - A request sent from the manager to the agent to discover the available variables on the MIB.

# GetBulk - A more efficient version of the GetNext message (introduced in SNMPv2).

## SNMP Write Messages
# Messages sent by the NMS to change information on the managed devices.

# Set - A request sent from the manager to the agent to change the value of one or more variables.
# The agent will send a Response message with the new values.

## SNMP Notification
# Messages sent by the managed devices to alert the NMS of a particular event.

# Trap - A notification sent from the agent to the manager. 
# The manager does not send a Response message to acknowledge that it received the Trap, so these messages are unreliable.

# Inform - A notification message that is acknowledged with a Response message.
# Originally used for communications between managers, but later updates allow agents to send Inform messages to managers too.

## SNMP Response
# Messages sent in response to a previous message/request.

### FTP and TFTP (File Transfer Protocol and Trivial File Transfer Protocol)

TFTP server port listen = UDP 69
FTP control port = TCP 21
FTP data port = TCP 20

# FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) is an upgrade to FTP.
# SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a different protocol to FTP.

# FTP is more compex than TFTP and allows not only file transfers, but clients can also navigate file directories, add and remove directories, list files, etc.

# In FTP active mode, the server initiates the data connection.
# In FTP passive mode, the client initiates the data connection, which is often necessary when the client is behind a firewall that could block the incoming connection from the server.

## Password Recovery for the 2900 Integrated Services Router
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/2800-series-integrated-services-routers/112033-c2900-password-recovery-00.html

# Step-by-Step Procedure
# Perform these steps in order to recover your password:

# 1. Either switch off or shut down the router.
# 2. Remove the compact flash that is on the rear of the router. This image shows the rear of the 2951 router:
# 3. Switch on the router.
# 4. Once the router is on Rommon mode, reinsert the compact flash.
# 5. Type confreg 0x2142 at the rommon 1> prompt in order to boot from Flash.
# This step bypasses the startup configuration where the passwords are stored.
# 6. Type reset at the rommon 2> prompt.
# The router reboots, but ignores the saved configuration.
# 7. Type no after each setup question, or press Ctrl-C in order to skip the initial setup procedure.
# 8. Type enable at the Router> prompt.
# You are in enable mode and should see the Router# prompt.
# 9. Type configure memory or copy startup-config running-config in order to copy the nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM) into memory.
# Warning:  Do not enter copy running-config startup-config or write. These commands erase your startup configuration.
# 10. Issue the show running-config command.
# The show running-config command shows the configuration of the router. In this configuration, the shutdown command appears under all interfaces, which indicates all interfaces are currently shut down. In addition, the passwords (enable password, enable secret, vty, and console passwords) are in either an encrypted or unencrypted format. You can reuse unencrypted passwords. You must change encrypted passwords to a new password.
# 11. Type configure terminal.
# The hostname(config)# prompt appears.
# 12. Type enable secret <password> in order to change the enable secret password. For example:
# hostname(config)#enable secret cisco
# 13. Issue the no shutdown command on every interface that you use.
# If you issue a show ip interface brief command, every interface that you want to use should display up up.
# 14. Type config-register <configuration_register_setting> . Where <configuration_register_setting> is either the value you recorded in step 2 or 0x2102 . For example:
# hostname(config)#config-register 0x2102
# 15. Press Ctrl-z or end in order to leave the configuration mode.
# The hostname# prompt appears.
# 16. Type write memory or copy running-config startup-config in order to commit the changes.


### NAT

# RFC 1918 private IPv4 ranges (cannot be used over the Internet):
# Class A - 10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)
# Class B - 172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255)
# Class C - 192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255)

## Static NAT

# Involves statically configuring one-to-one mappings of private IP addresses to public IP addresses.
# Inside Local IP address is mapped to an inside global IP address. The IP configured on the host. Usually a private IP address.
# Inside Global IP address is the IP address of the inside host after NAT. Usually a public IP address.
# Outside Local is the IP address of the outside host from the perspective of the local network.
# Outside Global is the IP address of the outside host from the perspective of the outside network.

# Inside / OUtside = Location of the host
# Local / Global = Perspective

# One-to-one mapping allows external hosts to access the internal host via the inside global address.


## Static NAT Configuration

# Define inside interfaces connected to the internal network
int g0/1
ip nat inside
exit
# Define outside interfaces connected to the external network
int g0/0
ip nat outside
exit
# Configure the one-to-one IP address mappings
# ip nat inside source static [inside-local-ip] [inside-global-ip]
ip nat inside source static 192.168.0.167 100.0.0.1
# The following command will be rejected as a static entry already exists
ip nat inside source static 192.168.0.168 100.0.0.1

show ip nat translations
# Clear the dynamic IP translations only (static IP translations will remain)
clear ip nat translation *
show ip nat statistics


## Dynamic NAT

# The router dynamically maps inside local addresses to inside global addresses as needed.

# An ACL is used to identify which traffic should be translated.
# If the source IP is permitted by the ACL, then it will be translated.
# If the source IP is denied by the ACL, then it will NOT be translated (traffic will not be dropped).

# A NAT pool is used to determine the available inside global addresses.

# The mappings are still one-to-one (one inside local IP address per inside global IP address).

# If there aren't enough inside global IP addresses available (all are currently being used), it is called 'NAT pool exhaustion'.
# If a packet from another inside host arrives and needs NAT but there are no available addresses, the router will drop the packet.
# The host will be unable to access outside networks until one of the inside global IP addresses becomes available.
# Dynamic NAT entries will time out automatically if not used, or you can clear them manually.


## Dynamic NAT Configuration

# Define inside interfaces connected to the internal network
int g0/1
ip nat inside
exit
# Define outside interfaces connected to the external network
int g0/0
ip nat outside
exit

# Define the traffic that should be translated, permitted by the ACL
acccess-list 1 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.255

# Define the pool of inside global IP addresses (instead of prefix-length 24, you can use netmask 255.255.255.0)
ip nat pool POOL1 100.0.0.0 100.0.0.255 prefix-length 24

# Configure dynamic NAT by mapping the ACL to the pool
ip nat inside source list 1 pool POOL1

# Clear NAT table. Only dynamic NAT translations will be cleared (static NAT entries will remain)
show ip nat translations

show ip nat statistics
# UDP and ICMP mappings are cleared about 1 minute later (statistics show as extended entries)
# The original dynamic mappings will be cleared after 24 hours (statistics show as dynamic entries)


## Dynamic PAT

# Port Address Translation (aka NAT overload) translates both the IP address and the port number (if necessary).
# By using a unique port number for each communication flow, a single public IP address can be used by many different internal hosts.
# Port numbers are 16 bits = over 65000 available port numbers.

# The router will keep track of which inside local address is using which inside global address and port.

# Because many inside hosts can share a single public IP, PAT is very useful for preserving public IP addresses, and it is used in networks all over the world.


## Configure PAT (pool)

# Define inside interfaces connected to the internal network
int g0/1
ip nat inside
exit
# Define outside interfaces connected to the external network
