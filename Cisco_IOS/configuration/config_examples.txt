### Configure Hostname

configure terminal
hostname R1
do sh run | inc hostname


### Configure Interface with IP address

interface FastEthernet0/0
ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown


### Configure SSH on IOS Router or Switch

# There are four steps required to enable SSH support on a Cisco IOS:
# 1. Configure the hostname.
# 2. Configure the DNS domain.
# 3. Generate the SSH key to be used.
# 4. Enable SSH transport support for the virtual type terminal (vtys).

configure terminal
hostname R1
ip domain name cisco.com
username admin privilege 15 password Cisco123
line vty 0 4
transport input ssh
exit
line vty 5 15
transport input ssh
exit
crypto key generate rsa
1024
ip ssh version 2
end
wr


## Note: Older IOS supports the kind of RSA with SHA-1, and SHA-1 is considered very weak. This essentially means that there are no secure ways to connect to it over SSH.
# Workaround on client (However, be aware that this is a workaround and it's known to be insecure.):

sudo tee -a ~/.ssh/config > /dev/null <<EOT
