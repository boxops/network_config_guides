Generate and Configure SSH Keys
To generate SSH keys on the configuration management server and configure the public key on devices running Junos OS:

1. On the server, generate the public and private SSH key pair for the desired user, and provide any required or desired options, for example:
user@server:~$ cd ~/.ssh
user@server:~/.ssh$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): id_rsa_dc
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  *****
Enter same passphrase again: *****

2. Load the key from the server into the native SSH key agent (Juniper):
user@server:~$ scp /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa_dc.pub admin@192.168.100.1:/var/home/admin
Look up the key in the SSH agent:
user@router> file list /var/home/admin

3. Configure the public key on each device to which the Junos PyEZ application will connect, which could include devices running Junos OS or a console server connected to the device running Junos OS.
One method to configure the public key under the appropriate user account on a device running Junos OS is to load the public key from a file.
[edit]
user@router# set system login user username class super-user authentication load-key-file /var/home/admin/id_rsa_dc.pub
user@router# commit

4. Verify that the key works by logging in to the device using the key.
user@server:~$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_dc router.example.com 
Enter passphrase for key '/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa_dc': 
user@router>
