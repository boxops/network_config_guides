# Then configure a security zone for the interface:
set security zones security-zone untrust
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/1.0
# Allow host inbound traffic from an interface (configure individual services or all)
set security zones security-zone untrust interfaces ge-0/0/0.0 host-inbound-traffic system-services all

show security zones
show interfaces
