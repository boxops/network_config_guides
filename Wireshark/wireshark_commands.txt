We will examine each of the command line options in turn.

The first thing to notice is that issuing the command wireshark by itself will launch Wireshark. However, you can include as many of the command line parameters as you like. Their meanings are as follows ( in alphabetical order ):

-a <capture autostop condition>, --autostop <capture autostop condition>

    Specify a criterion that specifies when Wireshark is to stop writing to a capture file. The criterion is of the form test:value, where test is one of:

    duration:value
        Stop writing to a capture file after value of seconds have elapsed. 
    filesize:value
        Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1000 bytes, not 1024 bytes). If this option is used together with the -b option, Wireshark will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to the next one if filesize is reached. 
    files:value
        Stop writing to capture files after value number of files were written. 
    packets:value
        Stop writing to a capture file after value number of packets were written. 

-b <capture ring buffer option>

    If a maximum capture file size was specified, this option causes Wireshark to run in “ring buffer” mode, with the specified number of files. In “ring buffer” mode, Wireshark will write to several capture files. Their name is based on the number of the file and on the creation date and time.

    When the first capture file fills up Wireshark will switch to writing to the next file, and so on. With the files option it’s also possible to form a “ring buffer.” This will fill up new files until the number of files specified, at which point the data in the first file will be discarded so a new file can be written.

    If the optional duration is specified, Wireshark will also switch to the next file when the specified number of seconds has elapsed even if the current file is not completely filled up.

    duration:value
        Switch to the next file after value seconds have elapsed, even if the current file is not completely filled up. 
    filesize:value
        Switch to the next file after it reaches a size of value kilobytes (where a kilobyte is 1000 bytes, not 1024 bytes). 
    files:value
        Begin again with the first file after value number of files were written (form a ring buffer). 
    packets:value
        Switch to the next file after value number of packets were written, even if the current file is not completely filled up. 
    interval:value
        Switch to the next file when the time is an exact multiple of value seconds. 

-B <capture buffer size>, --buffer-size <capture buffer size>
    Set capture buffer size (in MB, default is 2MB). This is used by the capture driver to buffer packet data until that data can be written to disk. If you encounter packet drops while capturing, try to increase this size. Not supported on some platforms. 
-C <config profile>
    Start with the specified configuration profile. 
-c <capture packet count>
    This option specifies the maximum number of packets to capture when capturing live data. It would be used in conjunction with the -k option. 
--capture-comment <comment>
    Add the comment string to the capture file, if supported by the file format. 
-d <layer_type>==<selector>,<decode_as_protocol>
    "Decode As", see Section 11.4.2, “User Specified Decodes” for details. Example: tcp.port==8888,http 
-D, --list-interfaces

    Print a list of the interfaces on which Wireshark can capture, then exit. For each network interface, a number and an interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the interface, is printed. The interface name or the number can be supplied to the -i flag to specify an interface on which to capture.

    This can be useful on systems that don’t have a command to list them (e.g., Windows systems, or UNIX systems lacking ifconfig -a). The number can be especially useful on Windows, where the interface name is a GUID.

    Note that “can capture” means that Wireshark was able to open that device to do a live capture. If, on your system, a program doing a network capture must be run from an account with special privileges, then, if Wireshark is run with the -D flag and is not run from such an account, it will not list any interfaces.
--display <DISPLAY>
    Set the X display to use, instead of the one defined in the environment, or the default display. 
--enable-protocol <proto_name>, --disable-protocol <proto_name>
    Enable and disable the dissection of the protocol. 
--enable-heuristic <short_name>, --disable-heuristic <short_name>
    Enable and disable the dissection of the heuristic protocol. 
-f <capture filter>
    This option sets the initial capture filter expression to be used when capturing packets. 
--fullscreen
    Start Wireshark in full screen. 
-g <packet number>
    After reading in a capture file using the -r flag, go to the given packet number. 
-h, --help
    This option requests Wireshark to print its version and usage instructions (as shown here) and exit. 
-H
    Hide the capture info dialog during live packet capture. 
-i <capture interface>, --interface <capture interface>

    Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet capture.

    Network interface names should match one of the names listed in wireshark -D (described above). A number, as reported by wireshark -D, can also be used. If you’re using UNIX, netstat -i, ifconfig -a or ip link might also work to list interface names, although not all versions of UNIX support the -a flag to ifconfig.

    If no interface is specified, Wireshark searches the list of interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback interface if there are any non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if there are no non-loopback interfaces; if there are no interfaces, Wireshark reports an error and doesn’t start the capture.

    Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or “-” to read data from the standard input. Data read from pipes must be in standard libpcap format.
-J <jump filter>
    After reading in a capture file using the -r flag, jump to the first packet which matches the filter expression. The filter expression is in display filter format. If an exact match cannot be found the first packet afterwards is selected. 
-I, --monitor-mode
    Capture wireless packets in monitor mode if available. 
-j
    Use this option after the -J option to search backwards for a first packet to go to. 
-k
    The -k option specifies that Wireshark should start capturing packets immediately. This option requires the use of the -i parameter to specify the interface that packet capture will occur from. 
-K <keytab file>
    Use the specified file for Kerberos decryption. 
-l
    This option turns on automatic scrolling if the packet list pane is being updated automatically as packets arrive during a capture (as specified by the -S flag). 
-L, --list-data-link-types
    List the data link types supported by the interface and exit. 
--list-time-stamp-types
    List timestamp types configurable for the interface and exit. 
-m <font>
    This option sets the name of the font used for most text displayed by Wireshark. 

-n
    Disable network object name resolution (such as hostname, TCP and UDP port names). 
-N <name resolving flags>

    Turns on name resolving for particular types of addresses and port numbers. The argument is a string that may contain the following letters:

    N
        Use external name resolver. 
    d
        Enable name resolution from captured DNS packets. 
    m
        Enable MAC address resolution. 
    n
        Enable network address resolution. 
    t
        Enable transport layer port number resolution. 
    v
        Enable VLAN ID resolution. 

-o <preference or recent settings>

    Sets a preference or recent value, overriding the default value and any value read from a preference or recent file. The argument to the flag is a string of the form prefname:value, where prefname is the name of the preference (which is the same name that would appear in the preferences or recent file), and value is the value to which it should be set. Multiple instances of `-o <preference settings> ` can be given on a single command line.

    An example of setting a single preference would be:

    wireshark -o mgcp.display_dissect_tree:TRUE

    An example of setting multiple preferences would be:

    wireshark -o mgcp.display_dissect_tree:TRUE -o mgcp.udp.callagent_port:2627

    You can get a list of all available preference strings from the preferences file. See Appendix B, Files and Folders for details.

    User access tables can be overridden using “uat,” followed by the UAT file name and a valid record for the file:

    wireshark -o "uat:user_dlts:\"User 0 (DLT=147)\",\"http\",\"0\",\"\",\"0\",\"\""

    The example above would dissect packets with a libpcap data link type 147 as HTTP, just as if you had configured it in the DLT_USER protocol preferences.
-p, --no-promiscuous-mode
    Don’t put the interface into promiscuous mode. Note that the interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other reason. Hence, -p cannot be used to ensure that the only traffic that is captured is traffic sent to or from the machine on which Wireshark is running, broadcast traffic, and multicast traffic to addresses received by that machine. 
-P <path setting>

    Special path settings usually detected automatically. This is used for special cases, e.g., starting Wireshark from a known location on an USB stick.

    The criterion is of the form key:path, where key is one of:

    persconf:path
        Path of personal configuration files, like the preferences files. 
    persdata:path
        Path of personal data files, it’s the folder initially opened. After the initialization, the recent file will keep the folder last used. 

-r <infile>, --read-file <infile>
    This option provides the name of a capture file for Wireshark to read and display. This capture file can be in one of the formats Wireshark understands. 
-R <read (display) filter>, --read-filter <read (display) filter>
    This option specifies a display filter to be applied when reading packets from a capture file. The syntax of this filter is that of the display filters discussed in Section 6.3, “Filtering Packets While Viewing”. Packets not matching the filter are discarded. 
-s <capture snapshot length>, --snapshot-length <capture snapshot length>
    This option specifies the snapshot length to use when capturing packets. Wireshark will only capture snaplen bytes of data for each packet. 
-S
    This option specifies that Wireshark will display packets as it captures them. This is done by capturing in one process and displaying them in a separate process. This is the same as “Update list of packets in real time” in the “Capture Options” dialog box. 
-t <time stamp format>

    This option sets the format of packet timestamps that are displayed in the packet list window. The format can be one of:

    r
        Relative, which specifies timestamps are displayed relative to the first packet captured. 
    a
        Absolute, which specifies that actual times be displayed for all packets. 
    ad
        Absolute with date, which specifies that actual dates and times be displayed for all packets. 
    adoy
        Absolute with YYYY/DOY date, which specifies that actual dates and times be displayed for all packets. 
    d
        Delta, which specifies that timestamps are relative to the previous packet. 

    dd: Delta, which specifies that timestamps are relative to the previous displayed packet.

    e
        Epoch, which specifies that timestamps are seconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00) 
    u
        Absolute, which specifies that actual times be displayed for all packets in UTC. 
    ud
        Absolute with date, which specifies that actual dates and times be displayed for all packets in UTC. 
    udoy
        Absolute with YYYY/DOY date, which specifies that actual dates and times be displayed for all packets in UTC. 

-u <s | hms>
    Show timesamps as seconds (“s”, the default) or hours, minutes, and seconds (“hms”) 
-v, --version
    This option requests Wireshark to print out its version information and exit. 
-w <savefile>
    This option sets the name of the file to be used to save captured packets. This can be '-' for stdout. 
-y <capture link type>, --link-type <capture like types>
    If a capture is started from the command line with -k, set the data link type to use while capturing packets. The values reported by -L are the values that can be used. 
--time-stamp-type <type>
    If a capture is started from the command line with -k, set the time stamp type to use while capturing packets. The values reported by --list-time-stamp-types are the values that can be used. 
-X <eXtension option>

    Specify an option to be passed to a Wireshark/TShark module. The eXtension option is in the form extension_key:value, where extension_key can be:

    lua_script:<lua_script_filename>
        Tells Wireshark to load the given script in addition to the default Lua scripts. 
    lua_script[num]:argument
        Tells Wireshark to pass the given argument to the lua script identified by num, which is the number indexed order of the lua_script command. For example, if only one script was loaded with -X lua_script:my.lua, then -X lua_script1:foo will pass the string foo to the my.lua script. If two scripts were loaded, such as -X lua_script:my.lua -X lua_script:other.lua in that order, then a -X lua_script2:bar would pass the string bar to the second lua script, ie., other.lua. 
    read_format:<file_type>
        Tells Wireshark to use a specific input file type, instead of determining it automatically. 
    stdin_descr:<description>
        Define a description for the standard input interface, instead of the default: "Standard input". 

-Y <display filter>, --display-filter <display filter>
    Start with the given display filter. 
-z <statistics-string>
    Get Wireshark to collect various types of statistics and display the result in a window that updates in semi-real time. For the currently implemented statistics consult the Wireshark manual page.
